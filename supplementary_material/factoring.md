## Existence
In this section, we discuss the following (almost obvious) statement:

__Theorem__
Every integer $m > 1$ can be represented as the product of primes: there exists a positive integer $k$ and primes $p_1, ..., p_k$ such that $m = p_1 \times ... \times p_k$.

__Stop and think!__ What happens if $m$ is prime?

In this case, $k = 1$ and $p_1 = m$. So the phrase "product of primes" should not be taken too literally: in this case there is only one (prime) number in the "product" and the product is equal to this number. (One could even allow $m = 1$ by considering an "empty product" with no factors that is equal to $1$, but we will not go that far.)

Note also that we do not require the $p_1, ..., p_k$ to all be distinct: for example, $4 = 2 \cdot 2$ and $12 = 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 2$.
