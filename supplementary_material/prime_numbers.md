## Prime numbers
__Definition.__ A prime number is a positive integer $p > 1$ that cannot be represented as the product of two smaller positive integers.

__Stop and think!__ We previously defined the notion of a divisor. Using it, could you finish the statement: "A number $p > 1$ is prime if it does not have ..."?

A number $p > 1$ is prime if it does not have positive integer divisors except for $1$ and $p$.

Indeed, if $m = uv$ is composite where $u$ and $v$ are non-trivial divisors, then $u$ and $v$ are both smaller than $m$, making it impossible for either one to be equal to $1$. And if a number $m > 1$ has some non-trivial divisor $d$, then for some positive integer $q$ we must have $m = dq$ by the definition of a divisor, and neither $d$ nor $q$ can be equal to $1$, so both must be smaller than $m$.

__Stop and think!__ Is $1$ a prime number? 

It is tempting to guess that $1$ is prime since it cannot be expressed as the product of smaller positive integers (there are no smaller positive integers to pick from!). Still, our definition explicitly requires $p > 1$ for a prime, so $1$ is not considered a prime number (nor is it considered composite). But this is just a decision that most mathematicians agree with, not a theorem. 

See, for example, this [long stackexchange discussion](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/120/why-is-1-not-a-prime-number).
