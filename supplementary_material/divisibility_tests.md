## Divisibility Tests
In some cases, one can check whether $a$ is divisible by $b$ without trying to divide by $b$.

__Problem.__ What is the remainder and the quotient of $3756$ when divided by $10$?

Decimal system is really convenient here. Note that

$3756 = 3750 + 6 = 375 \cdot 10 + 6$

Thus the quotient is $375$ and the remainder is $6$.

Clearly, this argument can be generalized to give the following. 

__Lemma.__ The remainder of an integer $a$ when divided by $10$ is the last digit of $a$, the quotient is an integer resulting from $a$ by dropping its last digit off. 

__Corollary.__ An integer $a$ is divisible by $10$ if and only if its last digit is $0$.
