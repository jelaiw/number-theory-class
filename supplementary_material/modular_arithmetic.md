__Problem.__ What is the remainder of

$17 \times (12 \times 19 + 5) - 23$

when divided by $3$?

To actually perform all of the calculations in this expression would take some time. Can we avoid this? It turns out that we can. But before we do this, we need to study the remainders a bit more. 

__Definition.__ We say that two numbers $a$ and $b$ are congruent modulo $m$ if they have the same remainder when divided by $m$. We denote this by

$a \equiv b \mod{m}$

As we discussed above, numbers $a$ and $b$ have the same remainder when divided by $m$ iff $a-b$ is divisible by $m$. Thus, we can say that 

$a \equiv b \mod{m} \leftrightarrow m \mid a - b$

In other words, a number $a$ is congruent modulo $m$ to all numbers $a + km$ for integer $k$. In particular, if $r$ is the remainder of $a$ when divided by $m$, then $a \equiv r \mod{m}$.
